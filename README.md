This code gives us insights into the most popular movies and its ratings from rate.house ,
of ocurse i used requests module to get url and i used bs4 module for scraping and parsing 
i only took the movie title,release date and rate.house rating.Then i wrote this information into the CSV file
which is also uploaded and you can see.i also used paging and this is only 5 page's inforamtion(100 movies in total).
for paging i used for-loop.
